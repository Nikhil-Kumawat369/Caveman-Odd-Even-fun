# Caveman's Odd-Even 🦴

    Generates thousands of if/elif statements to check odd/even numbers. Don’t ask why 😅

>Because who needs loops when you can write thousands of `if/elif` statements?  
> Pure chaos, pure caveman logic. Don’t ask why — just enjoy the madness. 😅

## 🔹 What It Does

This Python script **generates a new Python file** with `if/elif` statements for every number up to the number you choose.  
- Checks if the number is **odd or even**  
- Uses **caveman-level logic** instead of proper programming loops  

---

## 🔹 How To Use

1. Clone or download the repository.  
2. Run `python3 generator.py`  
3. Enter the number **up to which you want to generate if/elif statements**  
4. Open the generated `generated.py` file and run it!  
5. Watch chaos unfold. ⚡

---

## 🔹 Example

If you enter `5` for generation, `generated.py` will contain:

```python
num = int(input('Enter the number you want to check Odd or Even :- '))

if num == 1 :
  print('Odd')
elif num == 2 :
  print('Even')
elif num == 3 :
  print('Odd')
elif num == 4 :
  print('Even')
elif num == 5 :
  print('Odd')
else :
   print('Hey, I was only trained for numbers up to 5. I cant handle above it.')
```

# ⚡ Why This Exists

- Fun, chaotic, and over-engineered

- A reminder: sometimes brute force > efficiency (for pure entertainment)

- Shows that programming can also be absurdly fun

- To be honest… even I don’t know why I made this 😅

# 🤪 Notes

    Don’t run this for extremely high numbers unless you like waiting forever

    Feel free to copy, run, and laugh at the madness
